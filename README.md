# cscreen 2023 silicon remaster

This is a re-release of the classic cscreen utility with support for apple silicon

Originally Created by Pye House in 2003 for command line manipulation of video settings

Only a couple of changes have been made over the years in order to keep it viable as OS X has changed over time

I'm making the source code available under the GNU GPL v3 license
